The first set of postcards could be more cohesive with the set if you changed the color of the font rather than adding a box around it. Perhaps put an overlay on the background (not Elon musk himself so the value is more consistent and its easier to pick a font color that contrasts)<br>


pay attention to the spacing between your quotes and the edge of your images—some of the margins are a little tight<br>

Perhaps create some kind of hierarchy between the quote and “-elon musk.” You can indent Elon musk, use different font weights/sizes, or italicize his name. <br>

You are missing a “ at the beginning of one of your quotes <br>

If you continue to use the boxes in the first set, perhaps pin them to an edge, so they are not just floating
