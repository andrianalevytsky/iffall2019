		Person giving feedback: Kirsten Holland <br>
		Feedback: 
		- check for misspellings (borscht? is spelled wrong)
		- the ingredients and directions open and close sections looks really readable but I'm not sure how easy it is to code?
		- I like the colors
		- maybe add images of the cooking process if you can find them?
		- the text could be a little bigger in terms of readability but I think it's still readable. but like I know my parents would hate reading at that size for example
		- center "ingredients" and "directions" in their boxes

		I think Kirsten's feedback was helpful and I plan to incorporate most of it (making the text bigger, checking spelling, etc). I am not sure I will be able to have images of the cooking process, since the recipe is an old family recipe and was originally just written down in a note book. Also, I am not sure I will be able to create an open/close section and if I cannot figure it out from google I will have to change that. As for centering "ingredients" and "directions," I will try it but I am not sure it will look better, so I may change it back.
