	<h1>Feedback from Kirsten</h1>
		<p>I like the interactive element of the dropdown things</p>
		<p>I'm not sure that "scroll to top" is necessary since the page is fairly short</p>
		<p>It might be nice to add some more pictures of borscht or some progress pictures of it for the steps, although I'm not sure how accessible those are to find</p>
		<p>the spacing between the bullet points and the numbers feels a little tight</p>
		<p>the yield, time section looks kinda ugly maybe put it in a box idk</p>
	<h1>Feedback from Alec</h1>
		<p>Drop down is good</p>
		<p>Right margin in the ingredients sections looks different than margin in directions section</p>
		<p>If you changed the recipe text at all there's some inconsistent wording. It says "and throw in the pot," "; throw in the pot," ", "then throw in the pot."</p>
		<p>Scroll to top function does not work on phone.</p>
