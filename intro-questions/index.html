			<li>
				<b>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</b>
					<br>My name is Andriana Levytsky. I am a junior studying communication design.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Tell me a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</b>
					<br>As I mentioned earlier, I am a com des major so this course is a graduation requirement.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell me a bit about it.</b>
					<br>No.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</b>
					<br>I want to be able to make <a href= "http://www.jellygummies.com">jelly gummies</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</b>
					<br>The process is very different, so I expect I will have to strategize very differently when trying to figure out what methods I have to use to create a certain image/look.

				<b>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</b>
					<br><a href= "https://www.pentagram.com">Pentagram</a>'s website is both easy to use and interesting to look at. The design not only fufills the functions it needs to fufill, but it is beautiful and complex. 
			</li>

				<b>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</b>
					<br>The <a href= "https://www.cooperhewitt.org">Cooper Hewitt</a>'s website creates hierarchy of information using different point sizes, colors, images in a grid, etc., but the design is still similar enough that it is all cohesive. It also incorporates details that indicate to the reader how they should interact with the website (i.e. when you place your cursor over a hyperlink, the font changes color). Therefore, the information reads well. 
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</b>
					<br><a href= "https://www.aiga.org">AIGA</a>'s website works well because it is dynamic yet not too overwhelming. The grid structure displays article links in an interesting but readible way, and the banner on top helps readers easily navigate the website. The formatting of the articles is also well done.
